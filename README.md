# Silver Bars Marketplace - Java Exercise

This application has been developed to support the functionality specified in the exercise's description.

The development followed the TDD methodology. There are two kinds of tests included in the project: unit test which cover the class level functionality, and acceptance tests which evaluate the system's compliance with the business requirements and assess whether it is acceptable for delivery.

The project is production ready with the exception of InMemoryRepository which should be replaced with one providing a persistent storage.
